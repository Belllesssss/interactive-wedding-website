#  NUAN Aisle Atelier interactive-wedding-website
NUAN Aisle Atelier is a full-stack wedding planning platform that streamlines the vendor-booking experience by helping users find services based on the geographic location of their wedding venue. This feature distinguishes the platform from traditional wedding websites, which typically list vendors without considering proximity.

The project includes:

A fully responsive, mobile-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Location-focused service discovery (upcoming backend integration)

Interactive components such as smooth scrolling, animated sections, parallax hero, and dynamic navbar

A functional contact form with simulated submission feedback

Planned integration of an AI chatbot to guide users through vendor selection, budgeting, and personalized planning

This project demonstrates experience in UI/UX, front-end development, and preparation for full-stack expansion with backend, database, and API integrations.
